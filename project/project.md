Fauzan Isnaini, fa20-523-313
## Abstract
Predicting the stock market is a complex task with lots of different variables comes into play. While it is difficult to predict the short-term volatility, there are several approaches to forecast stock market in the long term.  In this paper, we will analyze multiple methods to forecast Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic. The forecast will be based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis and sentiment analysis.
Keywords: stock, market, predictive analytics, LSTM, random forest, regression, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, sentiment analysis, pandemic
## 1. Introduction
The COVID-19 Pandemic is not just a crisis in the public health sector. It also impacts unemployment rates, business revenues, and mass psychology, which in the end lead to crashes in global stock markets. While some stock indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and NASDAQ Composite have already recovered, the Indonesian Stock Market Index (IDX Composite) is still far below its price before the pandemic.
Some of the possible causes are: 
1.	Foreign investments represent about 50% of the total fund in the IDX stock exchange. In a pandemic situation, foreign investors might choose to withdraw their stocks and find another safer country to invest in.
2.	Unpredictability of the pandemic situation drives investors to reallocate their funds in safer assets, such as cash, gold, or USD.
3.	Changes in the macroeconomic situation, such as unemployment rate, Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) exchange rate, and interest rate. 
4.	Changes in the consumer buying power also change the business revenues, thus changing fundamental data.
5.	Mass psychology of investors that the stock market is not safe in this pandemic situation, holding them from returning to the stock market
To predict the time needed for IDX Composite to recover, there are two indicators that can be utilized:
1.	Fundamental indicators, which represent the financial aspect. This can be in the form of macroeconomic data and a company financial report 
2.	Technical indicators, which represent the mass psychology of investors. This can be obtained from statistical analysis of how the stock market moves
3.	Sentiment analysis, which represent the mass psychology of Indonesian people. This can be obtained from Twitter and Google Trends.
## 2. Background Research and Previous Work

## 3. Choice of Data-sets
In predicting the outcome, these datasets will be utilized:
1.	Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com). Yahoo Finance contains a lot of both fundamental and technical data, and they are free of charge.
2.	Twitter (twitter.com). A sentiment analysis on twitter will be conducted to represent the mass psychology regarding the economic condition in Indonesia
